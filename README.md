# Acknowledgement

So far this is a 'code-along' based on a [Vue.js TDD tutorial](https://medium.com/magnetis-backstage/working-an-application-in-vue-js-with-tdd-an-extensive-guide-for-people-who-have-time-part-1-3be791dafa2b). It should at some point deviate from the [tutorial's source repository](https://github.com/kuroski/article-tdd-vue).

# TODO

Tutorial in progress, part 5 announced for November, 12th.
